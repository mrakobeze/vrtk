# VRTK - Video Releaser's Toolkit

VRTK is designed to help people who works with video publishing.
Currently it can:
* create video preview screenshots
* create screenlists (collage)
* more features soon!

## Installation

#### Windows

Install Ruby 2.4 from [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org). 
Also, download [FFMpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows).
FFMpeg from ImageMagick is not suitable since it doesn't have `ffprobe` program.

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vrtk

If install succeeds, check it by typing: 
```bash
$ vrtk help
```
